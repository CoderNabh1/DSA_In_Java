Max size of Array is 10^7.

It has Contiguous Memory Locations.

You can'nt use For-Each loop in java for insertion of elements.

.toArray() in ArrayList, HashSet

To remove duplicates add the last element by your own.

For second Largest element in the array find the largest and then compare it with other other with a not equal to case.

To left rotate a array K times you should first do K = K%Size of Array as it decreases the no. of array rotations.

For right rotation do k = n-k for right rotation.

Optimised solution of left rotating array is to first rotate the two sub arrays and then the full --> Total no. of rotations = 3.
Explanaton of this Algo. --> 
1. Reverse the subarray to 0 to k
2. Reverse the another subarray to k to arr.length
3. Reverse the Whole subarrray

To reverse a element we use two pointer approach
While(start < end)
{
    int temp = arr[start];
    arr[start] = arr[end];
    arr[end] = temp;
    start++;
    end--;
}

int maximum limit (2,147,483,647).

to implement Binary Search --> It should be a sorted Array.
1. First claculate mid = start+(end-start)/2 --> To cancel out int OverFlow Error
2. if (mid<k) start = mid + 1;
3. if(mid>k) end = mid - 1;

When you don't know the size of the array before hand use ArrayList.

Sum of Number from 1 to n = (n*n+1)/2

if you XOR same Numbers the XOR of that is 0.
0^1 = 0 and you have to add the last element by your own which will be +1 of the arr.length.

When you have Pair and you want to find Unnique element XOR can be a good idea.
